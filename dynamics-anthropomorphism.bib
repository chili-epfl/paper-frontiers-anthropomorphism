  abstract = {People excel at attributing intentionality to other agents, whether
	in simple scenarios such as shapes moving in two dimensions or complex
	scenarios such as people interacting. We note that intentionality
	attributions seem to fall into two categories: low-level intentionality
	in which an observer has a theory of mind about an agent, and high-level
	intentionality in which an observer believes the agent has a theory
	of mind about something else. We introduce the terms L-intentionality
	and H-intentionality to refer to these attributions, respectively,
	and describe this division by using examples from previous research.
	Social robots provide a particularly good platform for evaluating
	the presence of different types of intentionality, and we discuss
	how robots can help distinguish the relationship between H- and L-intentionality,
	based on a number of possible models that we enumerate. We conclude
	by highlighting some interesting questions about intentionality in
	general and the interplay between H- and L-intentionality in particular.}

	the extent to which our participants made anthropomorphic attributions

Likewise, little is known on how feedback of robot confidence interacts in real-time with trust and control allocation strategies. An experiment to examine these issues showed trust loss due to early reliability drops is masked in traditional post-run measures, trust demonstrates inertia, and feedback alters allocation strategies independent of trust. The implications of specific findings on development of trust models and robot design are also discussed.},

	region is probably the basis of the decoupling mechanism that distinguishes
	mental state representations from physical state representations;
	the STS region is probably the basis of the detection of agency,

	attribute intentions to them and, if so, whether such interactions
	resemble human-human interactions on a neural level. In social cognitive
	neuroscience the ability to attribute intentions and desires to others
	is being referred to as having a Theory of Mind ({ToM).} With the
	present study we investigated whether an increase of human-likeness
	of interaction partners modulates the participants' {ToM} associated
	cortical activity. By means of functional magnetic resonance imaging
	(subjects n = 20) we investigated cortical activity modulation during
	highly interactive human-robot game. Increasing degrees of human-likeness
	for the game partner were introduced by means of a computer partner,
	a functional robot, an anthropomorphic robot and a human partner.
	The classical iterated prisoner's dilemma game was applied as experimental
	task which allowed for an implicit detection of {ToM} associated
	cortical activity. During the experiment participants always played
	against a random sequence unknowingly to them. Irrespective of the
	surmised interaction partners' responses participants indicated having
	experienced more fun and competition in the interaction with increasing
	human-like features of their partners. Parametric modulation of the
	functional imaging data revealed a highly significant linear increase
	of cortical activity in the medial frontal cortex as well as in the
	right temporo-parietal junction in correspondence with the increase
	of human-likeness of the interaction partner (computer{\textless}functional
	robot{\textless}anthropomorphic robot{\textless}human). Both regions
	correlating with the degree of human-likeness, the medial frontal
	cortex and the right temporo-parietal junction, have been associated
	with Theory-of-Mind. The results demonstrate that the tendency to
	build a model of another's mind linearly increases with its perceived
	human-likeness. Moreover, the present data provides first evidence
	of a contribution of higher human cognitive functions such as {ToM},
	in direct interactions with artificial robots. Our results shed light
	on the long-lasting psychological and philosophical debate regarding

	human. In particular, he hypothesized that a person's response to
	a humanlike robot would abruptly shift from empathy to revulsion
	as it approached, but failed to attain, a lifelike appearance. This
	descent into eeriness is known as the uncanny valley. The essay appeared
	in an obscure Japanese journal called Energy in 1970, and in subsequent
	years, it received almost no attention. However, more recently, the
	concept of the uncanny valley has rapidly attracted interest in robotics
	and other scientific circles as well as in popular culture. Some
	researchers have explored its implications for human-robot interaction
	and computer-graphics animation, whereas others have investigated
	its biological and social roots. Now interest in the uncanny valley
	should only intensify, as technology evolves and researchers build
	robots that look human. Although copies of Mori's essay have circulated
	among researchers, a complete version hasn't been widely available.
	The following is the first publication of an English translation

The paper raises some cautions concerning social isolation and stereotypical behaviour frequently exhibited in children with autism. We present some examples taken from trials with the robots where the children exhibit such behaviour, and discuss possible ways of ensuring not to reinforce stereotypical behaviour and a tendency to social isolation in the children. Especially, we point out an avenue of robots becoming social mediators (mediating contact between children and other children or adults). The paper exemplifies interaction where social behaviour was directed at the robot which raises awareness of the goal of the research, namely to help the children to increase their social interaction skills with other people and not simply create relationships with a ‘social’ robot which would isolate the children from other humans even further.},

	However, insights into this topic are an important prerequisite when
	discussing, for example, ethical issues regarding the question of
	what role we (want to) allow robots to play in our lives. In line
	with the Media Equation, humans may react towards robots as they
	do towards humans, making it all the more important to carefully
	investigate the preconditions and consequences of contact with robots.
	Based on assumptions on the socialness of reactions towards robots
	and anecdotal evidence of emotional attachments to robots (e.g. Klamer
	and {BenAllouch} in Trappl R. (ed.), Proceedings of {EMCSR} 2010,
	Vienna, 2010; Klamer and {BenAllouch} in Proceedings of the 27th

	Artif. Intell. 25(6):474–502, 2011), we conducted a study that provides
	further insights into the question of whether humans show emotional
	reactions towards Ugobe’s Pleo, which is shown in different situations.
	We used a 2×2 design with one between-subjects factor “prior interaction
	with the robot” (never seen the robot before vs. 10-minute interaction
	with the robot) and a within-subject factor “type of video” (friendly
	interaction video vs. torture video). Following a multi-method approach,
	we assessed participants’ physiological arousal and self-reported
	emotions as well as their general evaluation of the videos and the
	robot. In line with our hypotheses, participants showed increased
	physiological arousal during the reception of the torture video as
	compared to the normal video. They also reported fewer positive and
	more negative feelings after the torture video and expressed empathic
	concern for the robot. It appears that the acquaintance with the
	robot does not play a role, as “prior interaction with the robot”
	showed no effect.},

  abstract = {As computational agents become more sophisticated, it will frequently
	be necessary for the agents to disagree with users. In these cases,
	it might be useful for the agent to use politeness strategies that
	defuse the person's frustrations and preserve the human-computer
	relationship. One such strategy is distancing, which we implemented
	by spatially distancing an agent's voice from its body. In a 2 (agent
	disagreement: none vs. some) x 2 (agent voice location: on robotic
	body vs. in control box) between-participants experiment, we studied
	the effects of agent disagreement and agent voice location in a collaborative
	human-agent desert survival task (N=40). People changed their answers
	more often when agents disagreed with them and felt more similar
	to agents that always agreed with them, even when substantive content
	was identical. Strikingly, people felt more positively toward the
	disagreeing agent whose voice came from a separate control box rather
	than from its body; for agreement, the body-attached voice was preferred.},
