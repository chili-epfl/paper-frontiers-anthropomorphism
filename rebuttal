|Yes
|The authors propose to use a factor R that describes how human like the robot
|is. There are no physical measurements that would enable us to measure
|anthropomorphism directly on a robot. We always have to go back to the
|perception of the humans.

One of the main point of the paper is to emphasize that anthropomorphism is
fundamentally a psychological phenomenon, and as such is not intrinsic
to the robot (the robot can, at best, *elicit* anthropomorphism by the human):
so we agree with the reviewer, we always (and only) have to go back to the human
perception. The variable 'R' simply reflects that, amongst the factors that result
in an anthropomorphic attitude, the robot design has an impact. It is not meant
as an operational metric that would be measured.

|No
|I fully understand why AntX would be a desirable indicator and the authors are
|able to describe it on a very high level of abstractions. But neither the
|authors nor I would know how to operationalize such an indicator. The devil is,
|as usual, in the detail. This is a common theme throughout the paper. The
|authors raise not necessarily novel, but certainly important issues in HRI but
|fail to provide concrete solutions. The suggestions the author make remain on a
|very high abstraction level. Their position take to the extreme would be:
|Anthropomorphism has something to do with robots and humans. I am also trying
|hard to find a truly novel contribution that is not just the summary of somebody
|else's work. The discussion of the benefits of questionnaires in comparison to
|observing behavior, for example, is not unique to HRI. It has been discussed in
|HCI for a long time.

Based on the feedback of the reviewers, we have undertaken a large rewrite of
the article to clarify our contribution: our intent *is not* to provide
concrete, applicable tools to measure anthropomorphism. Instead, our
contribution is more theoretical. The call for this special issue "Beyond the
Uncanny Valley Hypothesis" says that "the emerging picture indicates that the
relationship between humanlike realism and subjective experience may not be as
straightforward as the hypothesis suggests": along this line, our focus is to
contribute to the establishment of a comprehensive understanding of
anthropomorphism.

While our paper indeed relies on a lot of previous work, we have attempted to
organize this wealth of literature in a meaningful and systematic way. This
should hopefully provide a novel, better picture of the "anthropomorphism"
phenomenon to the community. We introduce in particular two models (that
materialize on one hand the dynamics of anthropomorphism, and on the other hand,
the underlying cognitive mechanism at play when we anthropomorphize) that are
expected to act as reference and support for the further research in this field.
We hope that the updated version of the paper evidence in a better way this
contribution.

|> Please add here any further comments on this manuscript.

|The ideas presented in this paper, as far as they are novel contributions of the
|authors, remain on a very high abstraction level and I doubt that it will be
|possible to operationalize them. 

We have tentatively answered this comment above. The discussion about the means to
operationalize our models is now solely in the 'Discussion' part of the article,
and we clearly state that this is not the focus of the article.

|No
|The proposal of the anthropomorphism index AntX remains very unclear as can be
|seen in Section 2.4. Here, the authors remain on a very speculative level using
|phrasings like "would like to take initial steps toward developing", "can be",
|"would also be interesting", "one could again think of assigning", "there may be
|a pre-defined maximum". This confusing indeterminism goes on in Section 3.1.1
|when the authors state that it "would theoretically be possible to compute a
|human specific value [..]" only to add in parentheses that "in practice this
|looks different". How this could lead to clear, testable hypothesis, which could
|be approached scientifically, is not even discussed once.

As explained to the Reviewer 1, we have conducted a large rewrite of the paper
to clarify our focus, which is to contribute to the establishment of a
comprehensive understanding of anthropomorphism at a theoretical level.
The concept of an anthropomorphism index 'AntX' has been indeed removed, as it
was outside of the core contribution of the article.

The point on the wording is well taken, and the whole article has been carefully
checked to ensure a suitable tone.

---

|> A Hypothesis and Theory article should not exceed 12'000 words. Should any

|Yes
|Without references the document comprises more than 15000 words. Perhaps, one of
|the sections about their own three research projects could be left out. In fact,
|the online survey word-count study seems quite irrelevant for the argument
|behind the development of AntX.

The article has been significantly shortened and we now count about 9200 words,
excluding references.
As suggested by the reviewer, the extensive presentation of previous studies has been
transformed into a brief summary of important results relevant to anthropomorphism.

---

|> What is the main hypothesis or theory reported in this manuscript?

|The main idea behind this manuscript is the argument that anthropomorphism is
|such a multi-faceted and complex phenomenon that it cannot only be derived from
|a robot's appearance/design. Also context and the characteristics of each human
|interlocutor are supposed to play into it. Therefore, the authors propose to
|discuss the development of an Anthropomorphism Index AntX, which should include
|all three aspects, human characteristics, robot characteristics, and context.
|The authors try to substantiate their argument with summaries of results of
|three of their own previous studies involving robots. The Roomba and the Domino
|study indeed support the authors' (new) notion of anthropomorphism (and how to
|research it) to some extend, but the Forum study somehow contradicts their own
|advice given later. That is, if the presentation of pictures and/or videos is
|insufficient to measure anthropomorphism, then analyzing online discussions
|about these devices seems similarly limited in what can be concluded with
|respect to the interactive, human-robot-specific phenomenon of subjectively
|ascribed anthropomorphism.
|Later, the authors correctly discuss previous research by Bartneck, Duffy,
|Takayama, Epley, Hegel, and others, who's empirical research is much better
|suited to support AntX. This happens after (on page 9) it is mentioned that
|"[t]he literature review helped us to better interpret our unexpected results",
|which is a surprising statement given that most of the then discussed literature
|has been available already before the authors' studies had been designed. Thus,
|they might/should have helped to form ones expectations beforehand.

The rewrite of the paper and the removal of the AntX index concept do resolve
these concerns.

---

|> Is the study presented in a consistent and succinct form?

|No
|First of all, not only one study is presented, but three previous studies are
|summarized. In result, it is understandable that the manuscript is too long.
|Secondly, at least to some extent the presented results do not really seem
|consistent with the proposed AntX measurement tool (see above).

We have tentatively answered this concern above.

---

|> Are there any objective errors or fundamental flaws in the hypothesis or
|> theory presented? If so, please specify.

|Yes
|The description of the "Anthropomorphism Index" remains on a much too general
|level to be useful as a basis for other researchers. Perhaps, this does not
|count as a fundamental flaw, but it deserves to be mentioned.

We have tentatively answered this concern above.

---

|> Does the title clearly and precisely reflect the main message of the
|> manuscript, as described in the author guidelines?

|No
|The title might better mention the proposed development of an anthropomorphism
|index as this seems to be the main idea behind the article.

Due to our initial presentation, the Anthropomorphism Index has been wrongfully
understood as one of the main contribution of the article. This should now be
fixed.

We however propose a new title ("Anthropomorphism in Human-Robot Interaction:
Nature, Dynamics and Underlying Cognitive Mechanisms") that further clarifies
the intent of the article.

---

|> Does the hypothesis or theory have a greater explanatory potential than
|> previously posed hypotheses or theories? If not, please explain the
|> deficiencies of this hypothesis or theory.

|No
|As said before, AntX remains on a superficial level. In fact, one could expect
|to find a kind of table that contains said "index". Saying that the value f some
|variables "might" range from 0 to 1 is clearly not helpful.

The rewrite of the paper and the removal of the AntX index concept do resolve
these concerns.


---

|> Is prior work properly and fully cited?

|No
|Actually, the omission of any work related to android robots such as
|Geminoid-type androids is surprising. These robots are often considered to be
|the prime example of "anthropomorphism by design". They should at least be
|discussed in one paragraph.

While we discuss important contributions from Ishiguro (in collaboration with
Kanda) to the field, the article does not focus on specific robots as it aims at
a certain level of generality.

|Below I have also included a detailed review of the manuscript:
|
|The paper “Dynamics of anthropomorphism in human-robot interaction” presents
|arguments on how to understand and measure anthropomorphism in the context of
|interactions between humans and robots. The authors argue that anthropomorphism
|needs to be considered from the perspectives of the user, the robot, and the
|context. They also suggest that anthropomorphism exists as a range instead of
|being dichotomous (being there or not), and that it evolves over time. More
|specifically, the authors suggest that measurements of anthropomorphism should
|also incorporate user’s familiarization with the robot. All arguments are based
|and/or building on existing literature, and they are included in a conceptual
|model that the authors call the Dynamics of anthropomorphism. In addition, the
|authors suggest a concept towards measuring anthropomorphism which they call the
|Anthropomorphism Index. The paper provides a broad and complete overview of
|existing literature, discussions on several aspects related to anthropomorphism
|and its measurement, which together contributes to the existing literature on
|anthropomorphism in HRI. I do find some issues that need to be addressed before
|accepting the paper. These issues will be stated below in order of their
|importance, from high to low.
|
|• In the first part of the paper, the authors aim to clearly and specifically
|state what they mean with anthropomorphism. They state that a robot does not
|contain anthropomorphism, but instead can give rise to the process of being
|anthropomorphized (69-71). Do they mean that anthropomorphism is then the
|outcome of this process? Also, the terms anthropomorphism, anthropomorphic, and
|anthropomorphized are used interchangeably without it being clear what they
|exactly mean by each. I would argue for clarifying this a bit more in the first
|part of the paper.
|
|• The authors present highly detailed results and discussions of three of their
|former studies on anthropomorphism (roomba, forum, and domino studies). The
|results are presented with figures and numbers (percentages, p-values etc.). To
|my view presenting these detailed results is superfluous in the current paper,
|because its aim is not to present empirical data. Instead I would argue to
|shorten the presentation of results and discussions from those three studies to
|the essential contributions to the current paper. The main findings of each of
|the studies can in my view be summarized to several sentences (not having
|separate heading for each of the three studies), including the references to the
|original work for more details.
|
|• When the authors introduce the Anthropomorphism Index, they frame it as a
|toolkit (281) or measurement tool (852) to measure anthropomorphism. Also, they
|refer to using a value that reflects how much a person anthropomorphized a robot
|in an interaction, which consists of combining the results on a number of
|hypothetical questions. However, they do not provide tools (i.e. measurement
|instruments) but instead a conceptual idea for measuring anthropomorphism. I
|would argue for framing it as they do in the introduction of the paper: a
|concept towards measuring anthropomorphism (91-92), and refrain from using
|concepts like tool(kit) or value.
|
|• In general, the authors use much abstract and lengthy language to present
|their ideas (especially in part 2.4 where they present a number of ways to
|include questions in anthropomorphism measurements). Also, the literature review
|in part 3 becomes rather lengthy due to this style, and as a reader I lost the
|structure of the argumentation at section 3.2.2. The authors provide an
|extensive overview and try to grasp it in a conceptual model, which is
|definitely worthwhile. However, I would argue that shortening part 3 and
|focusing on the contribution of each of the sections in it could greatly enhance
|(this part of) the paper’s readability. (for example, the authors suggest three
|cognitive stages at line 525, and begin explaining them in line 586)
|
|• The authors argue about the importance of including familiarization with
|robots in the measurement of anthropomorphism (line 677), but how does this
|relate to the 3 stage theory they presented before (588-655)? The way I
|interpret it is that the 3 stages are relevant for investigation of the user
|side, whereas the familiarization is relevant for the dynamics argument. I argue
|that the paper would benefit from (more) explicitly stating which
|aspect/theory/argument belongs to which aspect of anthropomorphism.
|
|• One of the main claims of the paper is that anthropomorphism should be
|measured according to each of the three main aspects (having multiple factors,
|being multi-layered, and being dynamic). The authors argue for the
|Anthropomorphism Index as a conceptual way of measuring anthropomorphism.
|Despite being one of the main arguments in the paper, this is not mentioned in
|the abstract. I would argue for including some information about this concept of
|measurement in the abstract.
|
|• In the discussion part of the paper, the authors present results from the
|roomba study. To my opinion this is not relevant material for a discussion part,
|but should instead be mentioned in the section where they present the main
|findings of that specific study.
|
|• The authors state that the statistical analysis of the interaction data was
|unfortunately not very conclusive (222). Do they mean that the results were
|unsatisfying (insignificant)? If so, I would argue to soften the argument in
|such a way that although not supported by statistical analyses, a pattern
|emerged.
|
|• There are some language issues. The authors often use the phrase ‘the authors’
|in their referencing, but it is not always clear whether they mean themselves or
|the authors of a reference they mentioned in that paragraph. Also, they often
|use words like give/think/call which are not considered to be academic language.
|In addition, there were some typos (e.g., line 110: bu; line 496: their; line
|497: ow). Please consider correcting these issues.
|
|• The authors refer to an unknown figure on line 74.
|
|• When describing the characteristics of the robot, the authors refer to a value
|R that indicates how much the robot is likely to anthropomorphized, ranging from
|0 to 1, with 1 being human. However, ‘human’ is not a likelihood for
|anthropomorphism.
|
|• In the caption of Figure 5 it says that the figure was adapted by, which
|should be adapted from.

We try here to address each of the points of the reviewer.

- the terminology that we used is now clearly stated and justified early in the
  article (section 1.2)
- we have removed the lengthy description of our studies, and replaced them by a
  short, 'to the point' summary of important results in regard to
  anthropomorphism (section 1.1)
- the concept of anthropomorphism index has been removed altogether since it was
  outside the core contribution of the paper, and not well supported.
- the lengthy wording has been entirely overhauled in the updated version of the
  paper. Its new structure should ease the reading, by ensuring short, balanced
  sections.
- we added 2 figures (Fig. 5 and 6) to explicit the relationship between the observed dynamics
  of anthropomorphism, and the underlying cognitive processes, as well as a
  specific discussion of their interplay (section 4.2).
- we have reworded the presentation of the 'dominos' interaction scatter plot as
  suggested by the reviewer.
- language/wording issues have been hopefully addressed in the updated version
  of the paper.
