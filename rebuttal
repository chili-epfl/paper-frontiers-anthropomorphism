|Yes
|The authors propose to use a factor R that describes how human like the robot
|is. There are no physical measurements that would enable us to measure
|anthropomorphism directly on a robot. We always have to go back to the
|perception of the humans.

One of the main point of the paper is to emphasize that anthropomorphism is
fundamentally a psychological phenomenon, and as such is not intrinsic
to the robot (the robot can, at best, *elicit* anthropomorphism by the human):
so we agree with the reviewer, we always (and only) have to go back to the human
perception.

The purpose of our article is to advance our understanding of this human
psychological phenomenon, and we focus in particular on how time impact
anthropomorphism.

|I fully understand why AntX would be a desirable indicator and the authors are

|fail to provide concrete solutions. The suggestions the author make remain on a
|very high abstraction level. Their position take to the extreme would be:
|Anthropomorphism has something to do with robots and humans. I am also trying
|hard to find a truly novel contribution that is not just the summary of somebody
|else's work. The discussion of the benefits of questionnaires in comparison to
|observing behavior, for example, is not unique to HRI. It has been discussed in
|HCI for a long time.

|The ideas presented in this paper, as far as they are novel contributions of the
|authors, remain on a very high abstraction level and I doubt that it will be
|possible to operationalize them.

|The proposal of the anthropomorphism index AntX remains very unclear as can be
|seen in Section 2.4. Here, the authors remain on a very speculative level using
|phrasings like "would like to take initial steps toward developing", "can be",
|"would also be interesting", "one could again think of assigning", "there may be
|a pre-defined maximum". This confusing indeterminism goes on in Section 3.1.1
|when the authors state that it "would theoretically be possible to compute a
|human specific value [..]" only to add in parentheses that "in practice this
|looks different". How this could lead to clear, testable hypothesis, which could
|be approached scientifically, is not even discussed once.

|Yes
|Without references the document comprises more than 15000 words. Perhaps, one of
|the sections about their own three research projects could be left out. In fact,
|the online survey word-count study seems quite irrelevant for the argument
|behind the development of AntX.


---

|> What is the main hypothesis or theory reported in this manuscript?

|The main idea behind this manuscript is the argument that anthropomorphism is
|such a multi-faceted and complex phenomenon that it cannot only be derived from
|a robot's appearance/design. Also context and the characteristics of each human
|interlocutor are supposed to play into it. Therefore, the authors propose to
|discuss the development of an Anthropomorphism Index AntX, which should include
|all three aspects, human characteristics, robot characteristics, and context.
|The authors try to substantiate their argument with summaries of results of
|three of their own previous studies involving robots. The Roomba and the Domino
|study indeed support the authors' (new) notion of anthropomorphism (and how to
|research it) to some extend, but the Forum study somehow contradicts their own
|advice given later. That is, if the presentation of pictures and/or videos is
|insufficient to measure anthropomorphism, then analyzing online discussions
|about these devices seems similarly limited in what can be concluded with
|respect to the interactive, human-robot-specific phenomenon of subjectively
|ascribed anthropomorphism.
|Later, the authors correctly discuss previous research by Bartneck, Duffy,
|Takayama, Epley, Hegel, and others, who's empirical research is much better
|suited to support AntX. This happens after (on page 9) it is mentioned that
|"[t]he literature review helped us to better interpret our unexpected results",
|which is a surprising statement given that most of the then discussed literature
|has been available already before the authors' studies had been designed. Thus,
|they might/should have helped to form ones expectations beforehand.

---

|> Is the study presented in a consistent and succinct form?

|No
|First of all, not only one study is presented, but three previous studies are
|summarized. In result, it is understandable that the manuscript is too long.
|Secondly, at least to some extent the presented results do not really seem
|consistent with the proposed AntX measurement tool (see above).

---

|> Are there any objective errors or fundamental flaws in the hypothesis or
|> theory presented? If so, please specify.

|Yes
|The description of the "Anthropomorphism Index" remains on a much too general
|level to be useful as a basis for other researchers. Perhaps, this does not
|count as a fundamental flaw, but it deserves to be mentioned.

---

|> Does the title clearly and precisely reflect the main message of the
|> manuscript, as described in the author guidelines?

|No
|The title might better mention the proposed development of an anthropomorphism
|index as this seems to be the main idea behind the article.

---

|> Does the hypothesis or theory have a greater explanatory potential than
|> previously posed hypotheses or theories? If not, please explain the
|> deficiencies of this hypothesis or theory.

|No
|As said before, AntX remains on a superficial level. In fact, one could expect
|to find a kind of table that contains said "index". Saying that the value f some
|variables "might" range from 0 to 1 is clearly not helpful.

---

|> Is prior work properly and fully cited?

|No
|Actually, the omission of any work related to android robots such as
|Geminoid-type androids is surprising. These robots are often considered to be
|the prime example of "anthropomorphism by design". They should at least be
|discussed in one paragraph.

|Figure 1 seems to need color to be fully comprehensible. I am not sure, if this
|is OK.
|Figure 5 seems to be taken directly out of Ruijten et al. (2014). Thus, this
|might be judged as plagiarism.

|Below I have also included a detailed review of the manuscript:
|
|The paper “Dynamics of anthropomorphism in human-robot interaction” presents
|arguments on how to understand and measure anthropomorphism in the context of
|interactions between humans and robots. The authors argue that anthropomorphism
|needs to be considered from the perspectives of the user, the robot, and the
|context. They also suggest that anthropomorphism exists as a range instead of
|being dichotomous (being there or not), and that it evolves over time. More
|specifically, the authors suggest that measurements of anthropomorphism should
|also incorporate user’s familiarization with the robot. All arguments are based
|and/or building on existing literature, and they are included in a conceptual
|model that the authors call the Dynamics of anthropomorphism. In addition, the
|authors suggest a concept towards measuring anthropomorphism which they call the
|Anthropomorphism Index. The paper provides a broad and complete overview of
|existing literature, discussions on several aspects related to anthropomorphism
|and its measurement, which together contributes to the existing literature on
|anthropomorphism in HRI. I do find some issues that need to be addressed before
|accepting the paper. These issues will be stated below in order of their
|importance, from high to low.
|
|• In the first part of the paper, the authors aim to clearly and specifically
|state what they mean with anthropomorphism. They state that a robot does not
|contain anthropomorphism, but instead can give rise to the process of being
|anthropomorphized (69-71). Do they mean that anthropomorphism is then the
|outcome of this process? Also, the terms anthropomorphism, anthropomorphic, and
|anthropomorphized are used interchangeably without it being clear what they
|exactly mean by each. I would argue for clarifying this a bit more in the first
|part of the paper.
|
|• The authors present highly detailed results and discussions of three of their
|former studies on anthropomorphism (roomba, forum, and domino studies). The
|results are presented with figures and numbers (percentages, p-values etc.). To
|my view presenting these detailed results is superfluous in the current paper,
|because its aim is not to present empirical data. Instead I would argue to
|shorten the presentation of results and discussions from those three studies to
|the essential contributions to the current paper. The main findings of each of
|the studies can in my view be summarized to several sentences (not having
|separate heading for each of the three studies), including the references to the
|original work for more details.
|
|• When the authors introduce the Anthropomorphism Index, they frame it as a
|toolkit (281) or measurement tool (852) to measure anthropomorphism. Also, they
|refer to using a value that reflects how much a person anthropomorphized a robot
|in an interaction, which consists of combining the results on a number of
|hypothetical questions. However, they do not provide tools (i.e. measurement
|instruments) but instead a conceptual idea for measuring anthropomorphism. I
|would argue for framing it as they do in the introduction of the paper: a
|concept towards measuring anthropomorphism (91-92), and refrain from using
|concepts like tool(kit) or value.
|
|• In general, the authors use much abstract and lengthy language to present
|their ideas (especially in part 2.4 where they present a number of ways to
|include questions in anthropomorphism measurements). Also, the literature review
|in part 3 becomes rather lengthy due to this style, and as a reader I lost the
|structure of the argumentation at section 3.2.2. The authors provide an
|extensive overview and try to grasp it in a conceptual model, which is
|definitely worthwhile. However, I would argue that shortening part 3 and
|focusing on the contribution of each of the sections in it could greatly enhance
|(this part of) the paper’s readability. (for example, the authors suggest three
|cognitive stages at line 525, and begin explaining them in line 586)
|
|• The authors argue about the importance of including familiarization with
|robots in the measurement of anthropomorphism (line 677), but how does this
|relate to the 3 stage theory they presented before (588-655)? The way I
|interpret it is that the 3 stages are relevant for investigation of the user
|side, whereas the familiarization is relevant for the dynamics argument. I argue
|that the paper would benefit from (more) explicitly stating which
|aspect/theory/argument belongs to which aspect of anthropomorphism.
|
|• One of the main claims of the paper is that anthropomorphism should be
|measured according to each of the three main aspects (having multiple factors,
|being multi-layered, and being dynamic). The authors argue for the
|Anthropomorphism Index as a conceptual way of measuring anthropomorphism.
|Despite being one of the main arguments in the paper, this is not mentioned in
|the abstract. I would argue for including some information about this concept of
|measurement in the abstract.
|
|• In the discussion part of the paper, the authors present results from the
|roomba study. To my opinion this is not relevant material for a discussion part,
|but should instead be mentioned in the section where they present the main
|findings of that specific study.
|
|• The authors state that the statistical analysis of the interaction data was
|unfortunately not very conclusive (222). Do they mean that the results were
|unsatisfying (insignificant)? If so, I would argue to soften the argument in
|such a way that although not supported by statistical analyses, a pattern
|emerged.
|
|• There are some language issues. The authors often use the phrase ‘the authors’
|in their referencing, but it is not always clear whether they mean themselves or
|the authors of a reference they mentioned in that paragraph. Also, they often
|use words like give/think/call which are not considered to be academic language.
|In addition, there were some typos (e.g., line 110: bu; line 496: their; line
|497: ow). Please consider correcting these issues.
|
|• The authors refer to an unknown figure on line 74.
|
|• When describing the characteristics of the robot, the authors refer to a value
|R that indicates how much the robot is likely to anthropomorphized, ranging from
|0 to 1, with 1 being human. However, ‘human’ is not a likelihood for
|anthropomorphism.
|
|• In the caption of Figure 5 it says that the figure was adapted by, which
|should be adapted from.
